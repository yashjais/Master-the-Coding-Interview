//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS - it starts searching closer to the root children's first

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// BFS (DFS will take a really long time for this)

//If the tree is very wide:
// DFS (BFS will need too much of memory - will need to keep track of nodes at current level)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
// BFS

// Validate BST
// BFS
